It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\nIf there are any issues, please check out our issue tracker https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues and add the issue if it isn't already recorded.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/450078/vimperator-3.14.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":693415,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$10.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":200,"totalDownloads":786062,"weeklyDownloads":1665,"dailyUsers":30391,"updateDate":1465407293000,"supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org"},{"id":"mytube@ashishmishra.in","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/65/65395-32.png?modified=1393834842","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/65/65395-64.png?modified=1393834842"},"name":"SmartVideo For YouTube","type":"extension","version":"0.979.1-signed.1-signed","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Ashish","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/naankari/?src=api"},"description":"Better YouTube experience.

(You can leave open the main Firefox window, that wont be affected at all). Very useful to identify addons incompatibilities.\n\nSimply run this command:\n  firefox.exe -no-remote -profile \"c:\\_Firefox_temp_profile\"\n\n    Having another Fx window with a fresh profile can also be useful to try at will this and other addons without interfering with your main Fx window/profile. (Just in case, more info here: \"Opening New instance of Firefox with another profile\" )\n\n\n\nTranslators tips!:\nIn Options Dialog, You can get almost all tooltip's texts visible at same time by adding the word \"dlgTooltips\" to preference entry: \"extensions.hide_caption.plus.z_sys.intFlags\".\n(Useful to review translated texts. Dialog can get pretty unresponsive at times and It will look like messed up, It's better to maximize it!)\n  The \"id\" value (with yellow bkg, showed for reference) at top of each tooltip is roughly equivalent to the corresponding DTD ENTITY ID.\n  Tips without \"id\" (cyan bkg) are the content of \"tooltiptext\" attributes (the ones that cannot include <tag>s)\nAnd for even messier look :-), and showing all popup-menus content at once: add also the word \"dlgPopups\" to that same preference.\nAt bottom it shows a new MenuList for seeing Popup-Notifications messages contained in main.properties file.\n\n    Update: 2016 July 23: There is a new version that is WORKING here:\n      http://beta.babelzilla.org/projects/p/Hide_Caption_Titlebar_Plus/ (since version 3.0.12pre).\n    We can use Babelzilla forum for any further discussion.\n    Thank you!\n","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-caption-titlebar-plus-sma/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":413,"totalDownloads":601179,"weeklyDownloads":1045,"dailyUsers":24005,"updateDate":1466300622000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/Javier-DarthPalpatine/firefox-hide-caption-titlebar-plus/issues?q=is:open+sort:updated-desc"},{"id":"@go-dictionary","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/683/683324-32.png?modified=1454570416","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/683/683324-64.png?modified=1454570416"},"name":"趣查 GoDictionary","type":"extension","version":"1.0.2","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Eric Zhou","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/iericzhou/?src=api"},"description":"[趣查]提供更简单快速的在线词典查询功能，方便你随时查询单词释义。你可以在页面中选中单词直接查询，也可以直接输入单词进行查询。[趣查]还提供查询多个不同的在线词典（有道词典、必应词典、爱词霸词典），方便你对比查询结果或选择自己最中意的在线词典。[趣查]目前支持中英互译。试一下，肯定能帮到你！(｡◝‿◜｡)","fullDescription":"#趣查 GoDictionary\n\n当一个Firefox重度依赖症患者兼程序员发现自己需要更方便地使用在线词典查询英文单词而没有找到简单顺手的插件工具时，他决定自己创建一个，方便自己使用；当然，他也非常愿意和大家分享，帮助到其他人。\n这就是［趣查］被创造的原因。\n\n［趣查］就是这样一个简单有用的助手。你可以通过在页面中选中单词后在右键菜单中点击查询；也可以在选中单词后直接点击浏览器工具栏的‘趣查’按钮进行查询；当然，你也可以点击工具栏‘趣查’按钮后直接输入想要查询的单词查看释义。你还可以选择不同的在线词典查询释义：1.有道词典；2.必应词典；3.爱词霸词典。\n\n［趣查］目前仅支持中英互译哟。试一下，肯定能帮到你！\n\n［趣查］—— 去查一下！(｡◝‿◜｡)","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/170/170819.png?src=api&modified=1454296451","width":"567","height":"276","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/170/170819.png?src=api&modified=1454296451","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"97"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/170/170820.png?src=api&modified=1454296451","width":"341","height":"444","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/170/170820.png?src=api&modified=1454296451","thumbnailWidth":"115","thumbnailHeight":"150"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/170/170821.png?src=api&modified=1454296451","width":"342","height":"444","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/170/170821.png?src=api&modified=1454296451","thumbnailWidth":"116","thumbnailHeight":"150"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/170/170822.png?src=api&modified=1454296451","width":"341","height":"443","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/170/170822.png?src=api&modified=1454296451","thumbnailWidth":"115","thumbnailHeight":"150"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/%E8%B6%A3%E6%9F%A5-godictionary/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/%E8%B6%A3%E6%9F%A5-godictionary/?src=api","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/395167/godictionary-1.0.2-fx.xpi?src=api","size":59030,"developerComments":"任何使用问题或源码查看问题请致邮iericzhou@163.com。","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/%E8%B6%A3%E6%9F%A5-godictionary/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":7,"totalDownloads":2569,"weeklyDownloads":50,"dailyUsers":314,"updateDate":1454567923000,"supportURL":null},{"id":"loop@mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"name":"Firefox Hello Beta","type":"extension","version":"1.4.3","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Standard8","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/standard8/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Ian Bicking","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/ianb/?src=api"}],"description":"The latest beta test version of Firefox Hello","fullDescription":"Firefox Hello is looking at addressing user needs via web sharing in Firefox.\n\nThis add-on is the latest version of the current in-development work that is released before the Firefox Hello is updated in Firefox.\n\nInstall it only if you want to help test the newest changes -

Now you can go one step further and also make it feel awesome to use!","fullDescription":"Contact Info: For reporting problems and bugs, or if you have comments or suggestions, please either send me an email (quicksaver@gmail.com) or go to https://github.com/Quicksaver/The-Fox--Only-Better/issues and create an issue, this is so I have a way to communicate with you if I need to.\n\nAustralis was the code name of the current Firefox theme, which first appeared in Firefox 29. It was an almost complete overhaul not only of the general look of the main browser window, but also of the underlying customization system. This add-on aims to fully and seamlessly integrate with Australis, while at same time provide a different, and hopefully better, feel when using the browser.\n\nSlim Chrome: Compress the top toolbars, including the location bar, into a tiny bar at the top of the browser, to save screen space and display web content to the maximum!\n\n- To access the toolbars, just move your mouse to the top of the window, or hit F6 to focus the location bar, and they will roll out in front of you.\n\n- The navigation bar can optionally be set so that it won't hide with the other toolbars. In this case, it will remain at the top of the browser like before, and only other toolbars, such as the Bookmarks Toolbar, will be hidden.\n\n- A mini bar, containing the current location, will appear when you change webpages, or when you are typing passwords, so that you are always sure of where you are.\n-- This mini bar can optionally appear when the cursor is on any other type of input field.\n\n- In addition to its corresponding option in the add-on's preferences dialog, Slim Chrome can be enabled or disabled through the toolbars context menu, and through a customizable keyboard shortcut, which by default is F9.\n\n- There are many appearance choices available (see screenshot), and also many different animation options. Try them all and choose the combination that best suits your taste!\n\nSky Lights give you readily accessible information about the current website without having to constantly show the toolbars, as a form of visual aid neatly packed into a small area at the top of the browser.\n\nIncluded Sky Lights:\n\n- Site Identity\n-- Clicking the light will open the same informative popup that usually opens when you click the identity box in the location bar.\n-- In case firefox blocked any content from loading for your safety, you can unblock it via clicking the light as well, just as you would by clicking the shield icon in the location bar.\n-- Important: the location bar, with the currently visited URL and the identity box next to it, provides crucial security information, to let you know that you are always where you should be and that it is safe to be there. Therefore, the add-on will not allow you to disable both the Site Identity light and the mini bar when changing locations, otherwise you won't have access to this information if the toolbars are hidden. Likewise, neither feature is needed when the navigation bar isn't included in the hidden toolbars, so they won't be enabled at all in that case.\n\n- Bookmark Page\n-- An equivalent to the Star icon of the Bookmarks button; indicates whether the current page is already bookmarked.\n-- Clicking the light will bookmark the current page, or open the Edit This Bookmark panel if the page is already bookmarked.\n\n- It is possible for other add-ons to add their own Sky Light, if they wish to fully integrate with Slim Chrome via this system. Please visit the following page for more information and, to add-on developers, for easy to follow instructions on how to do this: https://github.com/Quicksaver/The-Fox--Only-Better/issues/52.\n\nEnhance your Awesome Bar: the location bar is affectionately referred to as Awesome Bar by the good folks at Mozilla that develop it, for doing so much more than just taking you to a web address. Type in any words and it searches your recent history, your bookmarks, other open tabs, searches the web using your favorite search engine and can even show you suggestions to search for.\nNow you can truly bring out the best of it. Use it and abuse it!\n- Select which types and limit or increase how many suggestions to show you as you type in the location bar.\n- Right-click any suggestion to immediately paste its value into the location bar, so that you can quickly copy it or use it with another search engine.\n- Place your search engines in the location bar's panel, and click any of them to immediately open the search results for what you typed.\n- You can right-click a search engine, or use Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down on your keyboard (Command+Up and Command+Down on Mac), to define another search engine to be used by default until you select another one.\n- Take full advantage of these suggestions by customizing them to your taste, from several different styles and color themes based on frog's AwesomeBar Popup userstyle and my own personal tweaks.\n\nAdaptable Search Bar - keeps your Search Bar synchronized with your web searches, it will always reflect the term used when browsing any results page from a search engine.\n- Optionally show the search bar only when on a results page and when it's not empty, giving it a more informative role. If you try to type in it, it will take you to the location bar so you can search from there instead.\n- In the future there will be some sort of ability to add your own custom rules for other search pages. For now, if you'd like to see any other search engine work with this feature, just let me know.\n- Currently supported search pages: Google, Yahoo, Bing, Amazon, DuckDuckGo, eBay, MercadoLibre, Twitter, Wikipedia, Facebook, IMDb, YouTube, Baidu.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/140/140326.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"514","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/140/140326.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"147","caption":"The top toolbars are compressed into a tiny bar, they will appear when you move the mouse to the top of the window."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134246.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"165","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134246.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"47","caption":"The mini location notifier will always be visible when entering passwords."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134248.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"410","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134248.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"117","caption":"Themes (Personas) are fully supported"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/140/140328.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"493","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/140/140328.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"141","caption":"The available Slim Chrome styles (from top to bottom): Australis, Spacious, Compact and Full width."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/143/143652.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"628","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/143/143652.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"180","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Sky Lights give you information about the current webpage when you need it, without the need to open the toolbars themselves."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/143/143654.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"468","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/143/143654.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"134","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Sky Lights give you information about the current webpage when you need it, without the need to open the toolbars themselves."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/171/171024.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","width":"700","height":"279","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/171/171024.png?src=api&modified=1464185329","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"80","caption":"It is very easy to use the location bar with your favorite search engines.
